The Windows version comes in two releases,
<br>
**Python** and **C++**

## Build
Both theÂ **Python** and **C++** releases should be converted into binaries for the target system in order to run properly.

###### Wrote the Python version about 3 years ago when I was just a newbie. Sorry for the poor design patterns!
###### Maybe I'll rewrite them both in a more proper way someday...
